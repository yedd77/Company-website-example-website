                Accelerator is the 1st-ranked Level 5 and the strongest esper currently residing in Academy City. He is the second protagonist
                of the Science Side in the Toaru Majutsu no Index series. First appearing chronologically in Toaru Majutsu no Index as an 
                antagonist, he later becomes the male protagonist of the Science Side after Kamijou Touma defeated him. His journey to a more 
                "heroic" role in the story progresses after meeting and saving Last Order and is forced into an ironic twist of fate where his 
                life now depends on the Sisters, clones he previously killed by the thousands. He is also a major antagonistic character in 
                Toaru Kagaku no Railgun and the protagonist of Toaru Kagaku no Accelerator.

                In his role as a protagonist, he is forced to deal with the cruel Dark Side of Academy City and the secret conspiracies 
                surrounding it. As the most powerful esper of Academy City, his existence and powers are tied to the plans of Aleister Crowley, 
                the founder of Academy City, alongside Kamijou Touma.

                Accelerator appears as a skinny teen and has pale skin, moppy white hair, and red eyes. This is caused by his ability, 
                as it blocks ultraviolet rays, thereby preventing his body from producing melanin. His ability also reduces the outside 
                influence so much that it causes a loss of balance in his hormones, giving him what he calls an "androgynous appearance," 
                although there is definite evidence stated throughout the series that he is a boy.

                He also seems to have an affinity for black and white-themed clothing. He changes his initial clothing from a black shirt 
                with white striped patterns to a white shirt with V patterns sometime between Old Testament Volume 5 and Old Testament Volume 8. 
                He starts wearing a choker-style electrode to aid him with mobility, computation, and communication, although he states that it 
                makes up for less than half of his former calculation abilities, and uses a crutch after Old Testament Volume 5.
            </p>
            <p>
                When he is enraged or excited such as when fighting a strong or amusing opponent, such as Kamijou Touma during their first 
                encounter, he breaks into a wide grin and laughs, giving him a maniacal and sadistic appearance.

                Much of Accelerator's past is unknown, but he mentioned that he once had a "normal name" which has yet to be revealed, and 
                most likely never will, as Accelerator himself forgot it. The novels state that his last name consists of two kanji and his 
                first name three, yet his name had no real meaning in it
            </p>
            <p>
                Ever since taking the Power Curriculum Program, and realizing his powers, Accelerator was sent to a "special class", most likely,
                the Special Ability Institute, and spent much of his childhood there until he turned nine-years-old, before being moved into 
                another special class. Both of these had him as the only student. It can be presumed that this occurred before the incident 
                involving the military
            </p>
            <p>
                When Accelerator was a child, he couldn't fit in with the other children due to his powers, harming those that tried to get 
                close to him. Around at the age of ten, a particular incident with children escalated with Academy City being deployed against 
                him, and he later "gave up", and was sent to a special class. This has made him something of a loner and distrustful towards 
                other people. After some time, Accelerator was discovered by Kihara Amata, who trained him on how to control his powers and 
                influenced him enough for Accelerator to adopt his personality. It can be assumed that the Dark May Project started after 
                Accelerator acquired the cool personality he now has from Amata.
            </p>
            <p>
                Accelerator's ability made him the subject of an experiment attempting to create the first Level 6 esper; according to the 
                city's best supercomputer, Tree Diagram, this feat could only be achieved by killing Misaka Mikoto, the 'Railgun', 128 times. 
                However, because it was impossible to create 128 of these 'railguns', due to the 'Level 5 Mass Production Plan' only being 
                capable of producing a sub-standard clone of Mikoto at a power of Level 2-3, a substitute plan was arranged where Accelerator 
                would have to kill 20,000 Misaka clones in a variety of methods. He willingly joins the experiment to gain a reputation as the 
                most powerful and feared esper so that no one would be foolish enough to challenge him ever again. By the beginning of the Sisters 
                Arc (index), Accelerator has already killed the first 10,030 Misaka Clones and during the course of the arc, kills clone 10,031 
                before the experiment is ultimately stopped.
